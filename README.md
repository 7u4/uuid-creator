### UUID Generator

It can generate these kind of UUIDs:

- Random;
- Timestamp;
- Timestamp without MAC (private);
- Sequential;
- Sequential without MAC (private);
 
The *Sequential UUID* is a modified implementation of Timestamp UUID. All the octets deticated to timestamp in the Sequential UUID are in the "natural order". In the standard Timestamp UUID the octets of timetamp are arranged in an inversed order (RFC-4122, section 4.2).
